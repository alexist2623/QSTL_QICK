Support and community
---------------------

The main resource for communicating with developers and members of the QICK community is the `Unitary Fund Discord <http://discord.unitary.fund/>`_:

* Chat with us any time in the #qick channel.

* If you prefer voice chat, we also hold weekly office hours; check the `Unitary Fund calendar <https://unitary.fund/community/events/>`_ for details.

We also welcome bug reports and feature requests via `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/issues>`_.
